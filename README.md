### Overview of the project
Our aim is to focus on the fundemental of the algorithm, illustrating the advance of Dijkstra's algorithm in comparison with other common existing path-finding algorithm.

The paper of the project can be found in the repository.

### Our project have four main parts:
* Initialize the path-finding problem [Initialize the problem](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1v-msP3cjDrUYQZCFuw0Rmf1ddp-LyNbC?usp=sharing)
* Other approachs to tackle the problem [Brute Force and Bellman Ford Algorithm](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1bneU4oj7qQWKO-faKtpd_VYL9PmibubZ?usp=sharing)
